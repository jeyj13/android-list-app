# android-list-app
This application is an attempt to read from a .csv file and display its contents in the desired format.
As a basis for this application, I am learning from the parts of the Senior Software Project at Geneva College that I did not actively work on in order to both build a functional application in Xamarin and expand my knowledge. Unlike the Senior Software project, this will not need to send information out as it is intended for keeping a local list only for the user to read from and edit. Furthermore, the intention is to greatly expand the number of fields that will be displayed.

Current status: Can read an item from a hardcoded list and display the ListView with a customized format.
